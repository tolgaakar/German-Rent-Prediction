# German-Rent-Prediction

### Task Overview

Data used for this task is taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/corrieaar/apartment-rental-offers-in-germany/data

More details can be found on the `GermanRentPrediction.ipynb` notebook.


The task is divided into two main parts, focusing on machine learning model development for rent prediction:

1. Predicting Rent with Structural Data: Develop a machine learning model to predict the total rent using only the structural data. Exclude the description and facilities text fields for this model.
2. Predicting Rent with Structural and Text Data: Create a second machine learning model that predicts the total rent using both structural and text data (description and facilities). It is encouraged using modern generative AI techniques for processing text data.
